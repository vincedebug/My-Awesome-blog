    <h2>Welcome to my Super Awesome blog</h2>
    <p>I am Vince Ermino from Gubat, Sorsogon. I am currently learning front-end web development, and I am in my second year of my Computer Science program.</p>

    <p>Here are some interesting accomplishments of mine:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Won a quiz bee competition in Boy Scouts during grade school.</li>
      <li>Also won a mobile gaming tournament in our neighborhood as a team captain.</li>
      <li>Graduated high school with flying colors, even though I barely passed the math subjects in the preceding years and chose Computer Science as my major.</li>
      <li>Learned to swim on my ownâ€”props to adrenaline for making me jump into the open sea.</li>
    </ul>
